I have a CSV that contains Column A plus another three to five accompanying columns. Every value in Column A needs an "@" prefixed to it. (at the front)

Once that's done, the entire sheet must be re-sorted so that the shortest text in Column A appears first and the longest last. Please keep all other columns perfectly aligned with their corresponding rows during the sort.

PLEASE REMOVE DUPLICATES. Would be grateful if someone can finish in less than a day for a tip.

For someone who knows excel you can probably do this in 3

Additional notes:
• Several columns include special characters, so please leave those untouched.
• While you work, remove any duplicate rows that may exist after the "@" is added.

Deliverable: a single, cleaned CSV returned in the same structure, with "@" added, duplicates eliminated, and rows ordered from shortest to longest based on Column A.

I missed adding the excel file. I am trying to figure out where to go back and add it.
