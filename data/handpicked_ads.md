PDF-Word Data Entry Conversion

₹750-1250 INR / hour
I have a steady flow of text-based information arriving in PDF and Word files that must end up in a clean, well-structured Excel sheet so I can run quick analyses on it afterwards. You will be copying the text accurately, checking for typos, applying the correct column structure, and giving each batch a final pass for consistency and basic formatting.

You do not need advanced formulas—simple Excel skills, a sharp eye for detail, and the discipline to deliver on or before the agreed deadline are what matter most. I typically release work in small packages; once you finish one, the next will follow, so you can choose to bill hourly or per file.

For every assignment I will provide:
• The source PDFs or Word documents
• A template Excel file that shows the exact column order I need

Your deliverable is the completed template, error-free and ready for me to analyze.

Beginners are welcome as long as you are reliable and communicate promptly. If that sounds like you, let’s get started.




Google Sheets Data Entry Cleanup

₹750-1250 INR / hour
I have a small batch of mixed data—numbers and text—that needs to be copied into a Google Sheet, slotted into the right columns, and kept tidy. The category structure is already laid out for you in a pre-defined template, so the main focus is careful transfer, clear labelling, and a quick pass with basic formulas. Most rows will only need SUM totals, but an occasional COUNT will help me keep track of record volume.

Accuracy always outweighs speed here. If something looks unclear, a quick comment in the sheet is better than a silent guess. When you finish, the file should look clean, read logically from left to right, and require no extra reformatting on my end.

Deliverable
• A single Google Sheet populated, categorised, and checked for formula accuracy.

Astrology Event Database & Interface

I need a clean, portable database that records astrological event data—eclipses, planetary ingresses, retrogrades, you name it—and can be lifted straight into MySQL, . The core table structure should be normalized and come with keys, indexes, and a clear ERD so another hobbyist (or future-me) can understand it at a glance.

On top of that schema, build a simple HTML data-entry interface. Pure HTML/CSS with a dash of vanilla JavaScript is fine; no heavy frameworks. A small PHP helper for form handling is acceptable if it keeps things tidy, but the pages themselves have to load as plain HTML so they can live on any basic web host.

Inside the interface I’d like:
• A form to add, edit, and delete individual events (date, time, event type, brief notes).
• A lightweight search console where a user chooses an event type from a drop-down and instantly sees matching rows, ordered chronologically.

Export and portability matter just as much as the UI. Please include:
• An .sql file ready for import as well as a CSV dump.
• Brief “how-to” notes on moving the data to another engine (e.g., pg_dump / sqlite3 import).
• Any scripts used for seeding sample data.

I’ll consider it complete when the schema imports cleanly, the HTML pages talk to it seamlessly, and the search by type of astrological event returns accurate results without timeouts even on a modest shared host.


Personal Expense Categorization & Budgeting

₹100-400 INR / hour
Every day my digital-receipt app captures what I spend, and I export that feed straight into a Google Sheet. I need you to open that sheet once per day, tag every new line with the correct category—Food & Groceries, Transportation, Entertainment, or the catch-all “All Expenses”—and keep the file tidy and searchable.

After the entries are classified, use the same spreadsheet to build a simple budgeting view:
• weekly and monthly summaries,
• a running “budget-vs-actual” for each category,
• and a clear dashboard that highlights any overspend as soon as it happens.

Everything stays inside the spreadsheet; no third-party accounting software is required. A short Loom video or written note explaining any formulas you add will be enough documentation for me to maintain the sheet later.

If you can start this week and commit to updating the file daily (it takes only a few minutes), let me know your approach and any similar work you’ve done.



Excel Sheet Modification. Simple task for someone who knows excel

I have a CSV that contains Column A plus another three to five accompanying columns. Every value in Column A needs an “@” prefixed to it. (at the front)

Once that’s done, the entire sheet must be re-sorted so that the shortest text in Column A appears first and the longest last. Please keep all other columns perfectly aligned with their corresponding rows during the sort.

PLEASE REMOVE DUPLICATES. Would be grateful if someone can finish in less than a day for a tip.

For someone who knows excel you can probably do this in 3

Additional notes:
• Several columns include special characters, so please leave those untouched.
• While you work, remove any duplicate rows that may exist after the “@” is added.

Deliverable: a single, cleaned CSV returned in the same structure, with “@” added, duplicates eliminated, and rows ordered from shortest to longest based on Column A.

I missed adding the excel file. I am trying to figure out where to go back and add it.



Recruitment Data Cleanup & Insights

Ends in 5 days
$15-25 USD / hour
I have a single hiring tracker in Excel (about 47 rows) that has grown messy after several quarters of inconsistent updates. The immediate priority is to turn this file into a clean, analysis-ready dataset:

• Audit the whole sheet, flag and correct data-type mismatches, duplicate or missing values, and any inconsistent naming conventions.
• Re-structure columns so dates, candidate details, and hiring-stage fields use one uniform format throughout. If you spot a better field layout, propose it before implementing.
• Apply light, intuitive formatting—filters, conditional highlights, and a tidy header row—so anyone can scan the sheet and understand status at a glance.

Once the tracker is spotless, I need a succinct analysis that surfaces actionable insights. Typical examples might include time-to-hire by role, stages where candidates stall, or trends in source effectiveness, but I’m open to your recommendations on which dimensions matter most. Please include:

• A short narrative summary (1–2 pages) outlining key patterns, bottlenecks, and quick wins.
• Supporting pivot tables or charts embedded in a separate worksheet.

Acceptance criteria
– No validation errors when paste-tested into a fresh workbook.
– Dates, names, and stage labels fully standardized.
– Clear and detailed list explaining all changes made.
– Final file and insight report delivered in the same workbook, clearly labeled.
– The final structure and formatting must be easy to understand and simple to navigate for anyone on the hiring team.

I’m looking for someone comfortable with advanced Excel functions (Power Query, pivot tables, lookups) who can both tidy data and translate it into plain-English findings I can share with the wider hiring team.




Word Docs to Excel Workbook

$10-30 USD
Paid on delivery
I need a series of existing Word documents converted into a single, well-structured Excel workbook that people can fill in quickly without breaking the layout. The source files mix text fields, numeric inputs, and date entries, so every sheet you build must handle those three data types cleanly with proper data validation where it helps.

The workbook should be organised as multiple sheets, matching the logical sections of the Word docs. I also want a handful of simple formulas—think subtotals, averages, and automatic date-difference calculations—so users see key figures update the moment they enter data. Nothing advanced like macros is required, but clear cell protection, tab naming that mirrors the document headings, and professionally formatted tables are important for usability.

You’ll deliver an .xlsx file that mirrors the wording, headings, and instructional text from the originals, laid out so someone unfamiliar with Excel can open it and start typing. Once you send the draft, I’ll review it against the Word templates and share any tweaks; final approval comes when every field lines up and all formulas tally correctly.

Budget: $5-$15 per document, depending on complexity.

Description
Experience Level: Expert
Estimated project duration: Not sure
I require an excel spreadsheet that can be used as a dashboard to generate weekly and monthly reports, based on information provided. The spreadsheet will consist of two sheets - the first one showing the dashboard, and the second where I can paste in some data exported from one of our systems. Each week, new data will be pasted to the bottom of sheet 2. The dashboard should automatically update to reflect the new data that has been entered.

The dashboard will consist of 5 sections:

- Profitable vs Not Profitable Pie Chart - A pie chart will be displayed showing the total number of cases that were profitable, and the total number that were not profitable.

- Financial Forecast Graph - A stacked graph showing the total amount of fees collected each month, plus the total amount of extras charged each month. A line graph displaying the current financial target should also be shown (configurable). Bar graphs should be cumulative (i.e reflect this months totals + the totals of the financial year so far)

- Cases By Mortgage Type - A table showing total cases grouped by mortgage type. Count, total and average should be displayed.

- Cases By Advisor - A table showing total cases grouped by assigned advisor. Total count, then the count of profitable and not profitable cases should be shown, plus the overall total fees and average fee per case.

Completed cases table - list of all cases that completed during the selected period. These are the cases used to gneerate the above graphs and tables.

By default the report will show the previous weeks data, however this should be configurable. There will be a button to toggle between showing last weeks, last months, or a custom date range worth of data. When changed, the tables and graphs should update to reflect data included in the selected range.

Filter buttons will be provided next to entries in cases by mortgage and cases by advisor. On clicking one of these buttons, the Completed Cases table will be filtered to only show cases matching the filter option clicked (e.g only cases where Joe Bloggs is the advisor, or cases for mortgage type of first time buyer).

The spreadsheet should auto generate when additional data is entered in to the second sheet. It should support adding a years worth of data, and not require any formulas to be adjusted, or selection ranges to be updated.

The dashboard should be displayed in a high quality finish, coloured according to the company's colours. Below is a rough mockup of what the dashboard should look like.

I have a Google Sheets costing template with dependent dropdowns.

Column B = Section (Accommodation, Park Fees, Flights, etc.)
Column C needs a working dropdown that reads the named range from B

Everything is set up correctly, but I keep getting the “Please enter a valid range” error when trying to use INDIRECT (or any variation) in Data Validation → Dropdown (from a range).
I need someone who actually knows the current 2025 Google Sheets quirks to give me the one working formula (or tiny workaround) that finally makes it work – no long explanations, just the exact line to paste and it’s done.

Data Entry from Handwritten Notesl

I have a collection of handwritten notes that must be transcribed into Microsoft Word and presented in clearly formatted tables. Every piece of information on the page needs to be captured exactly as written, placed into the correct column, and checked for spelling consistency before submission. Accuracy matters more to me than speed, though I do want steady, reliable progress updates so I can spot-check as you go.

You will work directly in Word—no need to export to Excel first—using simple table styles that keep headings bold and entries left-aligned. If something in the handwriting is unclear, leave a highlighted comment rather than guessing; I will clarify so the document stays error-free.

Deliverables:
• A single .docx file containing all entries in tidy, uniform tables
• A short change log noting any ambiguous words you flagged for review

Once I verify the final file mirrors the original notes, the project is complete and ready for sign-off.

I have a collection of PDF files that need to be converted into accurate, error-free plain text. The task is straightforward: open each PDF, carefully transcribe its content, double-check for typos or missing lines, and deliver the result as clean, unformatted TXT files.

Because the information is text-only—no tables, charts, or special formatting—speed and precision matter more than layout skills. I will supply the PDFs and would like the returned files named exactly like the originals so I can cross-reference them quickly.

Deliverable
• One plain-text (.txt) file for every PDF provided, matching the source content word-for-word.

If you are meticulous with detail and can turn this around promptly, I look forward to working with you.


Summary
