Be realistic and conservative - many jobs require human judgment, creativity, or physical presence that AI cannot provide.\n\nTitle: PDF Text Data Entry\nStatus: \nBudget: \nDescription: \nRequirements: N/A\nDeliverables: One plain-text (.txt) file for every PDF provided, matching the source content word-for-word.\n\nThink carefully about:\n- What specific tasks need to be done?\n- Can AI actually perform these tasks autonomously?\n- Are there human elements required (judgment, creativity, communication, physical presence)?\n- What are the real limitations and barriers?\n- Would this require human oversight or intervention?\n\nBe critical: if the job requires human judgment, creativity, communication skills, physical presence, or domain expertise that AI lacks, mark it as NOT feasible.\n\nProvide your assessment as JSON:\n{\n  \"is_feasible\": true or false,\n  \"confidence\": 0.0-1.0,\n  \"reasoning\": \"detailed explanation of why it is or isn't feasible with AI\",\n  \"estimated_hours\": number or null,\n  \"risks\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"challenges\"]\n}\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must be valid JSON only. Rules:\n- All string values must be in double quotes\n- No newlines or control characters inside string values (use \\n for newlines)\n- No markdown code blocks\n- No text before or after the JSON\n\nRespond with ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.\n",

Key limitations include:\n   - **OCR Errors**: Even high-quality AI OCR may not perfectly replicate text from low-resolution scans, faded pages, or complex layouts.\n   - **Formatting Variations**: PDF metadata (e.g., headers, footers) or non-printable elements (tables with merged cells, handwritten notes) cannot always be extracted verbatim. Human review would be needed to resolve ambiguities.\n   - **Domain-Specific Rules**: Legal/technical documents may require interpretation of formatting (e.g., ‘1’ vs. ‘I’, footnote citations). An AI might misalign text if it lacks contextual knowledge or relies on flawed PDF parsing logic.\n   - **Bias in Training Data**: If the PDFs contain biased language, cultural references, or proprietary terms, an AI could output inconsistencies without oversight. Human judgment is needed to flag errors or variations.\n   - **Physical/Logistical Constraints**: If the job requires handling hundreds of large PDFs daily (e.g., legal filings), human speed and memory would outperform AI in error correction for complex cases.\n\n  **Mitigation**: This could be fully automated *if* the requirements were relaxed to allow minor formatting corrections, but the strict 'word-for-word' mandate creates irreconcilable gaps. Human oversight is necessary to handle edge cases, which would offset automation savings.\n\n  The core task (OCR + text extraction) can be done autonomously with current tools like Amazon Textract or custom Python pipelines, but human verification would be required for the 'word-for-word' guarantee.\",\n\n  \"estimated_hours\": null,\n  \"risks\": [\n    \"High error rate in OCR for low-quality PDFs (e.g., scanned images) → costly rework\",\n    \"False positives/negatives when AI misinterprets handwritten text or symbols\",\n    \"Legal/ethical concerns if variations are flagged as errors (e.g., typographical corrections)\",\n    \"Dependence on proprietary tools/licenses for large-scale processing\",\n    \"Inconsistency in output across different AI models trained on identical datasets\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
