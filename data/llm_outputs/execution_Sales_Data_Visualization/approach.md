# Approach

1. Load the CSV data using pandas and validate its integrity
2. Aggregate revenue by product_name using groupby and sum
3. Create a pie chart showing revenue distribution by product
4. Create a bar chart showing revenue for each individual product
5. Verify that the sum of all product revenues matches the total revenue from the raw data
6. Ensure all products are represented in the visualizations
7. Save both charts with high resolution and proper formatting

The approach ensures data integrity by validating sums and checking for missing products. The visualizations are created with readable labels and proper formatting for professional presentation.
