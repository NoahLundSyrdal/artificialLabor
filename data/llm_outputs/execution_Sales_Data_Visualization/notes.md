# Notes

- Assumed that the CSV file is in UTF-8 encoding
- Used floating point comparison with small epsilon (1e-6) for revenue sum verification
- Assumed that all products should be represented in the output (10 products total)
- Used high DPI (300) for output images to ensure quality
- The script includes comprehensive verification of success criteria
- The script handles missing data gracefully by removing rows with missing revenue
- The script includes error handling for file not found and parsing errors
