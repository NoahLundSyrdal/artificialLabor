I need you to open that sheet once per day, tag every new line with the correct category—Food & Groceries, Transportation, Entertainment, or the catch-all “All Expenses”—and keep the file tidy and searchable.\nAfter the entries are classified, use the same spreadsheet to build a simple budgeting view:\n• weekly and monthly summaries,\n• a running “budget-vs-actual” for each category,\n• and a clear dashboard that highlights any overspend as soon as it happens.\nEverything stays inside the spreadsheet; no third-party accounting software is required. A short Loom video or written note explaining any formulas you add will be enough documentation for me to maintain the sheet later.\nIf you can start this week and commit to updating the file daily (it takes only a few minutes), let me know your approach and any similar work you’ve done.\nRequirements: Open Google Sheet daily, Tag new entries with category: Food & Groceries, Transportation, Entertainment, or All Expenses, Keep file tidy and searchable, Build weekly and monthly summaries, Create budget-vs-actual for each category, Create dashboard to highlight overspend, Use only spreadsheet (no third-party software), Provide documentation (Loom video or written note) for formulas, Start this week, Commit to daily updates (few minutes per day)\nDeliverables: N/A\nBudget: \nPayment Terms: \n\nFollow this proposal structure:\n{\n  \"greeting\": {\n    \"description\": \"Professional greeting addressing the client\",\n    \"example\": \"Hello, I'm interested in your [Job Title] project.\"\n  },\n  \"understanding\": {\n    \"description\": \"Brief statement showing understanding of the project requirements\",\n    \"example\": \"I understand you need [brief description of main requirement].\"\n  },\n  \"approach\": {\n    \"description\": \"1-2 sentences describing your approach to completing the task\",\n    \"example\": \"I will use [tools/methods] to [achieve goal] efficiently and accurately.\"\n  },\n  \"deliverables\": {\n    \"description\": \"List of specific deliverables that will be provided\",\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"example\": [\n      \"Deliverable 1\",\n      \"Deliverable 2\",\n      \"Deliverable 3\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"timeline\": {\n    \"description\": \"Estimated completion time or 'To be discussed'\",\n    \"example\": \"I can complete this within [timeframe] or 'To be discussed'\"\n  },\n  \"pricing\": {\n    \"description\": \"Pricing proposal based on budget/payment terms from job posting\",\n    \"example\": \"My rate is [amount] [currency] [hourly/fixed] as per your budget.\"\n  },\n  \"next_steps\": {\n    \"description\": \"What happens next (e.g., 'Ready to start immediately', 'Available for discussion')\",\n    \"example\": \"Ready to start immediately upon acceptance.\"\n  }\n}\n\nGenerate a proposal that:\n- Shows understanding of the requirements\n- Outlines your approach\n- Lists deliverables clearly\n- Addresses timeline if mentioned\n- Matches pricing to client's budget/payment terms\n- Is professional and concise\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences, no extra text):\n{\n  \"greeting\": \"Professional greeting addressing the client\",\n  \"understanding\": \"Brief statement showing you understand the project\",\n  \"approach\": \"1-2 sentences describing your approach\",\n  \"deliverables\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"specific\", \"deliverables\"],\n  \"timeline\": \"Estimated completion time or 'To be discussed'\",\n  \"pricing\": \"Pricing proposal based on budget/payment terms\",\n  \"next_steps\": \"What happens next (e.g., 'Ready to start immediately')\"\n}\n\nCRITICAL: Output ONLY the JSON object.
