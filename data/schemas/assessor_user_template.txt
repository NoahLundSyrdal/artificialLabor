Assess the following freelance job posting:

```json
{{EXTRACTED_AD_JSON}}
```

Evaluate feasibility, estimate costs, calculate economics, and if viable (score >= 0.5 and positive margin), generate a client proposal and execution prompt.

Remember:
- Use MEDIUM tier ($0.50/1M tokens) for cost calculation
- Convert budget to USD for comparison
- Only proceed if feasibility >= 0.5 AND margin >= 30%
- Proposal should be professional but concise
- Execution prompt should be detailed and actionable
